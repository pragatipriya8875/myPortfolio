    <h4>Beyond Technology</h4>
    <p>
      When Iâ€™m not immersed in code, I come alive as a <strong>Poet</strong> â€” a space where stories unfold through
      voice, rhythm, and presence. Anchoring allows me to blend creativity with communication, a harmony I hold close to
      heart.
      <br><br>
      Beyond the stage and screen, I am a passionate reader who finds solace in literature. Iâ€™ve explored the rich
      tapestry of <strong>Hindi literature</strong>, diving into iconic works like <em>Godaan</em>, <em>Gaban</em>,
      <em>Nirmala</em>, <em>Rangbhoomi</em>, and <em>Sevasadan</em>. My love for Hindi novels â€” a true "Hindi Deep" â€”
      keeps me rooted in cultural depth and emotional storytelling.
      <br><br>
      I also enjoy contemporary and classic novels in English, including the mystical narrative of <em>Kafka on the
        Shore</em>, the haunting beauty of <em>The Kite Runner</em>, the profound introspection in <em>The
        Alchemist</em>, the rich symbolism of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, the layered reality of <em>Norwegian
        Wood</em>, and the emotional depth of <em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em>. Whether itâ€™s Indian or international,
      emotional realism or magical fiction, each story offers a new lens through which I view the world.
      <br><br>
      These narratives, whether shared aloud or printed on a page, enrich my life and fuel my love for storytelling â€”
      helping me blend logic with empathy, and technology with heart.
